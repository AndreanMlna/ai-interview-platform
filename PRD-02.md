## Phase 3 — Live Interview (T=0:02 to T=38:00)

### Exchange 1 — React surface probe

```
T=0:02  AI:       "Hi Ahmad, tell me about the most technically challenging
                   frontend project you've worked on recently."

T=0:05  AHMAD:    "At my last job we built a real-time dashboard for logistics
                   tracking — hundreds of concurrent updates per second. The
                   biggest challenge was keeping the React state in sync without
                   causing performance issues."

        → N6: Turn #2 saved { turn: 2, speaker: "candidate", text: "At my last job..." }

        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │  N7 ASYNC — starts immediately after Turn #2    │
        │  Input: last 2 turns + coverage map             │
        │  Gemini Flash analyzing...                       │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

        N8 INJECTS coverage map before AI responds:
        { skills: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", state: "initiated", probe_count: 1 },  ← updated
            { id: "communication", state: "not_yet", probe_count: 0 },
            { id: "system-design", state: "not_yet", probe_count: 0 }
          ],
          time_remaining_minutes: 43
        }

        [3s later] N7 COMPLETES:
        { skill_updates: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", new_state: "initiated", new_probe_count: 1,
              reason: "AI asked opening React question; candidate responded with React state challenge" }
          ],
          discovered_skills: [] }
        → N8 updates map: sk-eng-001 = initiated / probe_count 1

T=0:08  AI:       "Hundreds of updates per second is significant. How were you
                   managing that state — and what was breaking before you fixed it?"
        → N6: Turn #3 saved (ai)
```

### Exchange 2 — React deep probe (follow-up #1)

```
T=0:10  AHMAD:    "We were using Redux with websocket events dispatching actions
                   directly. The problem was every update triggered a full re-render
                   of the dashboard. We profiled it and found 80% of renders were
                   unnecessary. Eventually we moved critical real-time data into
                   local component state with useRef for things that don't need
                   to trigger renders, and used React.memo aggressively."

        │  N7 ASYNC — analyzing Turn #4                   │

        N8 INJECTS before AI responds:
        { skills: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", state: "initiated", probe_count: 1 },
              ← still initiated because N7 result not back yet (1 turn lag — acceptable)
            ...
          ]
        }

        [3s later] N7 COMPLETES:
        { skill_updates: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", new_state: "partial", new_probe_count: 2,
              reason: "probe_count >= 2; candidate showed solid React optimization but hasn't demonstrated testing strategy or broader architecture patterns" }
          ] }
        → N8: sk-eng-001 = partial / probe_count 2

        → U5 (assessor live monitor) receives WebSocket push:
          "React/Frontend Dev: initiated → partial"

T=0:14  AI:       "useRef for non-render-triggering state is smart. When you
                   profiled it — what tooling did you use, and how did you
                   decide where to draw the line between what stays in Redux
                   versus what moves to local state?"
        → N6: Turn #5 saved (ai)
```

### Exchange 3 — React: deeper probe + off-agenda discovery

```
T=0:17  AHMAD:    "React DevTools Profiler and Chrome Performance tab. For the
                   line — we kept Redux for anything that needed to be shared
                   across the app or persisted. Local state for ephemeral UI.
                   Separately, we also decomposed the app into micro-frontends
                   at some point because the team grew to 12 engineers and
                   deployments were becoming a bottleneck."

        N7 DETECTS: "micro-frontends" mentioned — off-agenda skill!

        [3s later] N7 COMPLETES:
        { skill_updates: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", new_state: "partial", new_probe_count: 3,
              reason: "Strong profiling and state partitioning reasoning — approaching covered but no testing/architecture pattern signal yet" }
          ],
          discovered_skills: [
            { label: "Micro-frontend Architecture", first_mention: "Decomposed app into micro-frontends with 12-engineer team" }
          ]
        }
        → N8: sk-eng-001 = partial / probe_count 3 ; discovered: Micro-frontend (initiated, probe_count 0)

        N8 INJECTS coverage map (now includes discovered skill):
        { skills: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", state: "partial", probe_count: 3 },
            ...
          ],
          discovered: [{ label: "Micro-frontend Architecture", state: "initiated", probe_count: 0 }],
          priority_next: "discovered"  ← system nudges: briefly probe discovery
        }

T=0:22  AI:       "Interesting — 12 engineers on one frontend is a real coordination
                   problem. How did you split the micro-frontends, and what did
                   Module Federation or the equivalent look like for you?
                   [Ahmad answers briefly — ~2 exchanges]
                   Right, good. What tends to break first at that kind of team
                   boundary? [Ahmad answers]
                   Okay. Let's come back to the dashboard — when you think about
                   the overall component architecture, how did you structure it
                   so new engineers could contribute without breaking things?"

        → N7 updates: Micro-frontend (initiated → partial, probe_count 2)
        → Coverage injection guides AI back to sk-eng-001 (still partial)
```

### Exchange 4 — React: covered

```
T=0:30  [After 2 more exchanges on component architecture and testing strategy]

        N7 COMPLETES:
        { skill_updates: [
            { id: "sk-eng-001", new_state: "covered", new_probe_count: 5,
              reason: "Candidate demonstrated: state management tradeoffs, profiling methodology, component architecture, test strategy (unit+integration+e2e). Sufficient for L3 assignment." }
          ]
        }
        → N8: sk-eng-001 = covered

        → U5 push: "React/Frontend Dev: partial → covered ✓"

        Coverage map now shows:
          sk-eng-001:    covered   ✓
          communication: not_yet
          system-design: not_yet
          discovered:    Micro-frontend (partial)
          priority_next: "communication"
```

### Exchanges 5–8 — Communication (abbreviated)

```
T=0:32  AI naturally bridges: "The way you described convincing the team to move
                               away from Redux — walk me through how that conversation
                               actually went. Who was in the room?"

        [6 exchanges covering: how Ahmad framed the proposal, how he handled pushback,
         how he documented the decision for async teammates]

T=0:51  N7: communication → covered (probe_count 4)
        → U5 push: "Communication: not_yet → covered ✓"
```

### Exchanges 9–11 — System Design

```
T=0:53  AI bridges: "You've described some complex systems. If you were starting
                     the logistics dashboard from scratch today, with everything
                     you know now — where would you start the design?"

        [5 exchanges on: component hierarchy, data layer design, performance budget]

T=1:08  N7: system-design → covered (probe_count 3)
        → U5 push: "System Design: not_yet → covered ✓"
```

### Session End (T=38:00)

```
N8 detects: ALL configured skills = covered

        N8 INJECTS final message with time warning:
        { "all_skills_covered": true, "wrap_up": true }

T=38:00 AI:  "I think we've covered everything I wanted to explore today.
              That was a solid conversation, Ahmad. Do you have any questions
              about the role or the engineering team?"

        [30s Q&A, then Ahmad says he's good]

T=38:45 AI:  "Great. Thanks for your time — you'll hear back shortly."

T=38:45 Ahmad clicks [End Interview] (or session ends naturally when AI finishes)
        → N9: session status = ended, ended_at = T=38:45, duration_seconds = 2325

He handles complex state management problems with clear tradeoff reasoning and owns performance optimization end-to-end including profiling and measurement. His testing strategy is mature for a mid-level engineer, covering unit through e2e.

  Culture & Competency:
  "Ahmad's technical depth and ownership mindset align strongly with TechCorp's
  engineering culture. He frames problems commercially (performance risk vs.
  technical preference) and shows systematic thinking. The communication gap
  at L2 vs required L3 is the primary area to probe in a hiring conversation —
  specifically whether he can drive async communication proactively rather than
  reactively. His system design capability exceeding the role requirement is a
  positive signal for growth headroom."
